# Interactive Inputs GitHub Action

GitHub Action for executing interactive inputs via Telegram

## About

Interactive inputs are inputs that are being controlled durring the execution of a workflow run.

This means that instead of manually triggerring workflows with inputs (`workflow_dispatch` with `inputs`), you can utilize the Interactive Inputs Action. This action allows inputs to appear on Telegram while the workflow is running.

With this approach, you have control over the options presented to the user, including the duration for which the user can make a choice, among other parameters. Eventually, you will receive the user's choice and you will be able to use it in the rest of the workflow. Under the hood it works via long polling mechanism.

## Usage

```
name: Interactive Inputs
on: [push]
jobs:
  get-choice:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test interactive inputs action
        id: interactive-inputs-action
        uses: NivEz/interactive-inputs-action@v1 # You can use a different version / tag @vx.x.x
        with:
          telegram-api-token: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN }}
          telegram-chat-id: ${{ secrets.CHAT_ID }}
          question: How are you today?
          options: '["Good", "Bad", "Ok"]' # Notice the serialized JSON with quotes
          default-choice: Ok
      
      - name: Get output
        run: 'echo The user response is: ${{ steps.interactive-inputs-action.outputs.user-choice }}'                
```

You can change the inputs for different behaviour:
```
name: Interactive Inputs
on: [push]
jobs:
  get-choice:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test interactive inputs action
        id: interactive-inputs-action
        uses: NivEz/interactive-inputs-action@v1
        with:
          telegram-api-token: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN }}
          telegram-chat-id: ${{ secrets.CHAT_ID }}
          question: How are you today?
          timeout: 30
          options: '["Good", "Bad", "Ok"]'
          default-choice: Ok
          wait-for-timeout-to-finish: true
          message: 'Answer is: %s'
          timeout-message: You did not choose anything
          is-choosing-required: false
      
      - name: Get output
        run: 'echo The user response is: ${{ steps.interactive-inputs-action.outputs.user-choice }}'                
```

You can even send a simple Telegram message (without all the interactive inputs functionality):
```
name: Telegram Message
on: [push]
jobs:
  send-message:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test simple message
        uses: NivEz/interactive-inputs-action@v1
        with:
          telegram-api-token: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN }}
          telegram-chat-id: ${{ secrets.CHAT_ID }}
          simple-message: This is a simple message without any logic      
```

Note that you have other tags then `v1`, but `v1` is equivalent to the most updated v1.x.x. You can use a different version / tag @vx.x.x if you want.
